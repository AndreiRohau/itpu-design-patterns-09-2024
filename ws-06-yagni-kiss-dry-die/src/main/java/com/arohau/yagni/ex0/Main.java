Examples of YAGNI

1. Feature Creep avoided:
A development team is working on a web application.
They initially plan to include a feature that allows users to create and share custom avatars.
However, after considering the time and resources required to implement this feature,
they decide to postpone it until they receive feedback from users indicating that it is necessary.

2. Complexity Reduction:
A developer is working on a mobile app that allows users to track their exercise routines.
Initially, they plan to include a feature that automatically generates personalized
workout plans based on the user’s fitness goals.
However, after considering the complexity of implementing this feature and the potential impact on the app’s performance,
they decide to stick with a simpler approach that allows users to create their own workout plans manually.

3. Resource Allocation:
A development team is working on an e-commerce platform.
They initially plan to include a feature that allows users to create Wishlist and share them with friends.
However, after considering the limited time and resources available for the project,
they decide to focus on other features that are more critical to the platform’s success.

4. Scope Management:
A development team is working on a software project for a client.
The client initially requests several additional features that they believe will be necessary for the project’s success.
However, after considering the project’s budget and timeline,
the development team decides to limit the scope of the project to only include the most critical features.

5. Feedback-Driven Development:
A development team is working on a new software product.
They initially plan to include a feature that allows users to provide feedback on the product’s performance.
However, after considering the potential impact on the product’s usability and
the time required to implement this feature, they decide to postpone it until
they receive feedback from users indicating that it is necessary.
